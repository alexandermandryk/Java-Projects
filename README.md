<h1>Java Applications</h1>

<div class="section">
  <h2>About This Repository</h2>
  <p>Welcome to the <span class="highlight">Java Applications</span> repository! This collection showcases my journey in programming with Java, spanning various categories of projects. Below are the three main categories included in this repository:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Princeton Internet Marketing Projects:</strong> These projects and algorithms were created to streamline processes in specific projects I worked on. Due to privacy restrictions, only a portion of my work is included, some files required to run these projects are missing, and data has been randomized or outright redacted. In hindsight, these projects could be implemented more efficiently in Python.</li>
    <li><strong>Project-Based:</strong> These are projects I developed during high school and in my free time as I transitioned to Rutgers. They explore various aspects of Java, including visualization, databases, and game development.</li>
    <li><strong>Research / Educational:</strong> These projects were developed in collaboration with my high school Data Structures class. They demonstrate a range of data structures and their applications.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Most of the projects are organized as IntelliJ IDEA folders, but their structure is easily adaptable to other environments.</p>
